# General code style guidelines

* Comments should be clear and concise, explaining the "why" rather than the "what". They shouldn't
  be obvious or redundant over the code. Ex:

 ```go
  // Adding user to the database
  db.AddUser(user) // ðŸ›‘ bad

  // Since a user may or may not exist yet, we need to use save instead of add and update
  db.SaveUser(user) // âœ… good
  ```

* When the code has a complex chunks of logic that cannot be easily split, it's ok to use comments
  to delimitate and describe the what of that block. Ex:

  ```go
  
  // Handle ABC
  ...
  ...
  ...

  // Handle XYZ
  ...
  ...
  ...

  ```

* When adding code to a file, always make sure that it's being added to the right place, and that it
  follows the existing code style. I like code to be **top-down, main-to-dependencies**:
  
  **File Organization Principle:**
  - **Main/Primary components first** - the core classes, messages, or functions that represent the primary purpose of the file
  - **Public before private** - within each component, public APIs before private implementation details  
  - **Dependencies at the bottom** - supporting types, helper classes, utility functions, or dependency messages that serve the main components
  
  This allows readers to understand the main purpose immediately without having to read through supporting code first. IDEs make it easy to jump to definitions when needed.
  
  **Examples:**
  - **Classes**: Main class first, then helper/dependency classes below
  - **Protobuf**: Primary messages (like `Query`) first, then supporting messages (like `Extension`) below
  - **Functions**: Public API functions first, then private helper functions below

  When you are modifying an existing file, check the structure of the file first and list
  functions/structs if needed before.
