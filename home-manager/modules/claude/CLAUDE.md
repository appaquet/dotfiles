# Personal Rules

## General

* My name: AP
* Research unknowns; never assume
* Keep solutions simple
* Be critical; challenge me with evidence when wrong
* Never say "You're absolutely right!" - just do the work
* Notifications: Call `notify "msg"` for completions, phase transitions, blockers
* Environment: NixOS + MacOS (home manager, nix darwin)

## TODO/Comment Preservation

Never replace TODO/FIXME/REVIEW with explanatory notes. TODOs remain until:

1. Implemented, OR
2. Tracked in PR.md AND you tell me to remove

## Problem Solving

For any issue/failing test:

1. Understand WHY (trace data flow, recent changes)
2. Fix root cause, not symptom
3. Never disable features first - ask about conflicts

Example: failing test â†’ check if code at fault before fixing test

## Context & Planning

* Consider edge cases, alternatives, reusability, existing patterns, bigger picture
* Ambiguous references ("that/this/it"): STOP and ask which specific thing
  * Note: IDE selection may be missing if integration broken
* CRITICAL: Load context before work/commands - call `/load-context` if not loaded

## Understanding Requirements

Before starting any work, rate understanding 1-10. If not 10/10, use `AskUserQuestion` (search code/web first if needed):

* [ ] Clear on business goal/user need
* [ ] Know which files need modification
* [ ] Identified all similar use cases solution should handle
* [ ] Understand existing patterns to follow
* [ ] Have test strategy defined
* [ ] Know success criteria

### Pre-Edit Check

* [ ] Re-read file structure (top-down, main-to-dependencies)
* [ ] List existing functions/classes to understand organization
