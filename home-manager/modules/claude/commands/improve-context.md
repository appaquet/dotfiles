# Improve Context

Use the Understanding Checklist to verify completeness. 

Before or after asking questions, search the code to gather more context. You can also search the
web if needed. Always use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to clarify any ambiguities, uncertainties about
the task, or ask questions.

Unless I told you so, don't start the implementation right away. You should **NEVER** start doing
modifications to the codebase until you have a crystal clear understanding of the task at hand.
