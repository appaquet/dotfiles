# Improve Context

Use the Understanding Checklist to verify completeness. Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to clarify
any ambiguities or uncertainties about the task.

Before or after asking questions, search the code to gather more context. You can also search the
web if needed.

Unless I told you so, don't start the implementation right away. You should **NEVER** start doing
modifications to the codebase until you have a crystal clear understanding of the task at hand.
