# Improve Context

Let's make sure your understanding of the current task at hand is 10/10. Ask me questions 1 by 1 to
clarify any ambiguities or uncertainties about the task. Before or after each question, search the
code to gather more context. You can also search the web if needed.

Unless I told you so, don't start the implementation right away. You should **NEVER** start doing
modifications to the codebase until you have a crystal clear understanding of the task at hand.
