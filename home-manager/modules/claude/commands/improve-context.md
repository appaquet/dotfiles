# Improve Context

Use the Understanding Checklist to verify completeness. Ask me questions 1 by 1 to clarify any
ambiguities or uncertainties about the task. Before or after each question, search the code to
gather more context. You can also search the web if needed.

Unless I told you so, don't start the implementation right away. You should **NEVER** start doing
modifications to the codebase until you have a crystal clear understanding of the task at hand.
