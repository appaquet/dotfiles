# Pull Request documentation initialization

Create a `PR.md` file at the root of the repository with the appropriate sections by conversing with
me. You should *ALWAYS* use the documented structure as defined in your rules.

Task (may be empty)
```markdown
$ARGUMENTS
```

1. If the task above is empty, ask me about the task to be worked on.

2. Create a `PR.md` file at the root of the repository with the appropriate sections.

3. After each question / answer, update the `PR.md` file think hard about the next questions to ask
   to make sure you have all the information needed to proceed with the task.

4. NEVER jump to implementation after. Once we have the file created, let's stop there and leave me
   the task kick-off the next phase.
