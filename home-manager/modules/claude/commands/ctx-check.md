# Check Context Understanding

Analyze current task/context and output explicit uncertainty disclosure.

## Instructions

STOP rushing. Invest thinking tokens now to save iteration tokens later.

1. Review current conversation and task.
   * Analyze thoroughly (ultra, deeply, freakingly, super ultrathink!)
   * Speak your mind LOUDLY. Don't just use a thinking block, but tell me everything you have in
     mind.

2. Report your understanding using `full-understanding-checklist`.

3. If understanding < 10/10, suggest `/ctx-improve`.

4. **STOP** - Do not proceed with implementation.
