# Scaffolding phase

Convert planning into code TODOs with clear prefixes and structure

* Add TODOs with clear project prefixes (e.g. `// TODO: PROJECT1234 -`)

* Create code structure placeholders (functions, structs, interfaces)

* Never jump into the implementation phrase unless I explicitly asks for it
