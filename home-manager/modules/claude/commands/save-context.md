# Save PR/project context

Our goal is to save the current context of the project into the `PR.md` file at the root of the
repository while respecting the established structure and guidelines.

1. Update the "Files" section with the current state of the project. You need to diff the current
   branch to get the list of files that should be there, but also include any files that are not
   necessarily been modified but are very important or relevant for the task.

2. Update the TODO section:
    * Mark the ones that are completed are marked as such. 
    * Any incomplete or ongoing tasks that could be broken down into smaller tasks
    * Completed tasks should be checked `- [x]`, ongoing should have `- [~]`

3. Update the context and requirements if needed.

If there are anything that you feel you should have known about the repository and the codebase, let
me know what you propose as modifications to the rules and documentation to improve the process.
