# Save PR/project context

Save the current context of the project into the `PR.md` file at the root of the repository.

Make sure to follow the established structure and update the "Files" section with the current state
of the project. You can diff the current branch to get the list of files that should be there.

Make sure the tasks are updated, and the ones that are completed are marked as such. Any incomplete
or ongoing tasks that could be broken down into smaller tasks should be noted as such.

If there are anything that you feel you should have known about the repository and the codebase, let
me know what you propose as modifications to the rules and documentation to improve the process.
