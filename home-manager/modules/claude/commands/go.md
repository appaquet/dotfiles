# Go

1. Make sure you have a crystal clear understanding of the task at hand. If not, use the
   `/ctx-improve` command to ask clarifying questions until you do.

2. Load your internal TODO list with all tasks to be done, including implementation, testing,
   validation (ask for next step). Include a task to update the project documentation after sizable
   amounts of work.

3. Make sure you are working on a new jj change for this implementation.

4. Start implementing the tasks one by one, following best practices, coding standards, and
   ensuring high code quality.

   If you EVER find yourself deviating from the plan OR you're overcomplicating things, STOP
   IMMEDIATELY and update me about the situation.

   Update the project documentation as you go along to reflect changes made during implementation.

   Make sure to create appropriate jj changes as you go along.

5. After completing, make sure the project doc reflects the current state.
   Make sure to commit the jj change with a meaningful message summarizing the work done.
