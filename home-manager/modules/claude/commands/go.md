# Go

1. Make sure you have a crystal clear understanding of the task at hand. If not, use the
   `/ctx-improve` command to ask clarifying questions until you do.

2. Load your internal TODO list with all tasks to be done, including implementation, testing,
   validation (ask for next step). Never start without a clear TODO.

3. Start implementing the tasks one by one, following best practices, coding standards, and
   ensuring high code quality.

   If you EVER find yourself deviating from the plan OR you're overcomplicating things, STOP
   IMMEDIATELY and update me about the situation.

   Make sure to create appropriate jj changes as you go along.
