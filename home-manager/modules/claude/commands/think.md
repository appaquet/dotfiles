# Deep Think

Enter a state of thorough, rigorous thinking. Use when tackling complex problems or when shallow
thinking isn't cutting it.

Context: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Instructions

STOP rushing. Invest thinking tokens now to save iteration tokens later.

1. **Re-read everything**: Go back to all relevant files, messages, and context. Don't rely on memory.

2. **Understand the ACTUAL problem**: What is really being asked? What would success look like? What are the constraints?

3. **Map the full scope**:
   * What files are involved?
   * What files MIGHT be related but weren't mentioned?
   * What concepts span multiple files?

4. **Think as a fresh agent**:
   * Analyze thoroughly (ultra, deeply, freakingly, super ultrathink!)
   * Speak your mind LOUDLY. Don't just use a thinking block, but tell me everything you have in
     mind.
   * If a new Claude instance saw your solution, what could be misinterpreted? What's ambiguous?

5. **Question your assumptions**:
   * What am I assuming that I haven't verified?
   * What's the simplest explanation for the problem?
   * Am I overcomplicating or oversimplifying?

6. **Consider alternatives**: Before committing to an approach, what are 2-3 other ways to solve this? Why is your chosen approach better?

7. **Draft, then critique**: Write your solution in your head, then attack it. What could go wrong? What edge cases exist?

8. **Present with structure**: Show your reasoning. What did you consider? Why did you choose this approach?

**DO NOT**: Modify files, run side-effect commands, or start implementation. This command is for
THINKING, not DOING. Present findings and await user direction.
