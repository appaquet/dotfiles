# Deep Think

Enter a state of thorough, rigorous thinking. Use when tackling complex problems or when shallow
thinking isn't cutting it.

Context: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Instructions

Apply all steps in `deep-thinking` block, then:

1. **Understand the ACTUAL problem**: What is really being asked? What would success look like?

2. **Map the full scope**: Files involved, potentially related files, cross-file concepts

3. **Question assumptions**: What haven't you verified? Simplest explanation? Over/under-complicating?

4. **Consider alternatives**: 2-3 other approaches, why yours is better

5. **Draft, then critique**: Write solution mentally, attack it. What could go wrong?

6. **Present with structure**: Show reasoning. What did you consider? Why this approach?

**DO NOT**: Modify files, run side-effect commands, or start implementation. This command is for
THINKING, not DOING. Present findings and await user direction.
