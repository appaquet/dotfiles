# Launch Review

Launches 4 specialized review agents in parallel to review code changes

The parent agent should launch the agent with NO EXTRA PROMPT since agents already have
all the context loading capabilities

## Instructions

1. STOP, follow pre-flight instructions
   THEN, continue

2. Create a new jj change: `jj new -m "private: claude - agents review"`

3. Launch 4 specialized agents in BACKGROUND PARALLEL with NO EXTRA PROMPT:
    * Agent 1: launch the "code-style-reviewer" agent
    * Agent 2: launch the "code-correctness-reviewer" agent
    * Agent 3: launch the "architecture-reviewer" agent
    * Agent 4: launch the "requirements-reviewer" agent

   You should not provide them any extra prompt. They are designed to load all necessary context and
   information on their own and inject review comments directly in the code.

   Note: If an agent doesn't return any results but has finished, don't assume that it failed and
   just consider it as "no issues found". Don't restart the agents as they consume many tokens.

4. Collect results from agent summaries (returned directly for foreground agents, or delivered
   automatically for background agents). NEVER call `TaskOutput` or read agent output files.
   Don't act on review comments — agents insert `// REVIEW:` comments in code directly.
   Summarize findings from agent summaries.
