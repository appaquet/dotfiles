# Neovim README
This is a collection of keymaps and commands for my Neovim setup. It doesn't contain only personal
keymaps, but also default/built-ins that I tend to forget.

## General keymap
* `<leader>` is space

* `<leader>qa` to quit neovim
* `<leader>qs` to clear auto-session and quit neovim

## Buffers (b)
* `]b` to switch to next buffer
* `[b` to switch to previous buffer
* `<leader>b 1 through 9` to switch to buffer 1 through 9
* `<leader>b<tab>` to switch to last buffer
* `<leader>bc` to open a new empty buffer
* `<leader>bq` to close the current buffer by trying not to mess up the layout
* `<leader>bo` to close all buffers except the current one
* `<leader>ba` to close all buffers
* `<leader>bs` or `<ctrl-s>` to save current buffer

## Tabs (n)
* `]n` to switch to next tab
* `[n` to switch to previous tab
* `<leader>nc` to open a new tab

## Layout
* `ctrl-w w` to switch between panes
* `ctrl-w r` or `ctrl-w R` to rotate panes
* `ctrl-w c` or `ctrl-w o` close current split OR others.

## Fzf (f)
* `<ctrl-p>` or `<leader>ff` fuzzy finding file names
* `<ctrl-l>` or `<leader>fs` fuzzy find in current file
* `<ctrl-g>` or `<leader>fS` fuzzy find in workspace (ripgrep)
* `<ctrl-b>` or `<leader>fb` fuzzy find through buffers
* `<leader>w` fuzzy find word under cursor in file
* `<leader>W` fuzzy find word under cursor in workspace
* `<leader>fk` fuzzy find through keymaps
* `<ctrl-\>` or `<leader>fc` fuzzy find through neovim commands
* `<leader>fr` to resume last search 
* See [fzf.lua](./home-manager/modules/neovim/conf/fzf.lua) for all keymaps
